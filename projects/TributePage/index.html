                <li><strong>1939</strong> - Lamarr figured out that by tranmitting radio signal's along rapidly changing ("hopping") frequencies. U.S. radio-guided torpedos would be dair more resilient to detecting and jamming.</li>
                <li><strong>1940</strong> - Finished work on the 'frequency hopping spread spectrum with George Antheil - an avante-garde composer.</li>
                <li><strong>1942</strong> - Lamarr and Antheil patentend their "Secret Communications System" which used radio frequences to create an unbreakable code for secret messages. </li>
                <li><strong>1962</strong> - The U.S. military re-considered and utilized frequency hopping spread spectrum technology during the Cuban missile crisis. </li>
